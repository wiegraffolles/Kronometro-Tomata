##Kronometro Tomata

Kronometro Tomata (KT) is a web application designed to let you use the Pomodoro Technique to manage your time more effectively and with more peace of mind. It includes the most basic time tracking and recording elements of the technique while leaving more complex recording up to the user to do as they like. Personally I like to use a simple pen and notebook to keep track of activities, other people prefer to use complex spreadsheet methods. KT leaves it up to you.

KT began as a project to correct the weak points me and my friends saw in the popular [Tomato Timer]("http://tomato-timer.com/) webapp. It also was a learning project for me to get used to writing Javascript and JQuery code, as well as to using the Foundation framework. KT includes the settings functions that the developer of Tomato Timer promised but did not get around to including. It also is persistent and saves your timer progress across sessions so that even if you accidentally close the KT tab you can immediately reload it without losing your progress.

**Note:** The creator of Tomato Timer has recently created a new web app with improved timer and stopwatch functionality, which can be found [here](http://online-current-time.en.downloadastro.com/tools/).
